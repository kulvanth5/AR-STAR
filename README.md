In this work, we propose a novel solution with the Attention-based Rectified Linear Unit Stackable Recurrent Cell (AR-STAR), a model specifically designed to effectively identify and classify underrepresented crop types, even when limited data is available. By incorporating Attention mechanisms within a STAckable Recurrent framework, AR-STAR enhances the model's ability to focus on critical patterns, ensuring better generalization to rare classes as well.

We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on a leading benchmark ZeuriCrop dataset from cantonments of Switzerland captured and labelled in 2019, which was proposed in https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.08820. Mustards, Beets, Summer Rapeseed, Tobacco, Buckwheat, Pumpkin and Winter Rapeseed are the few under-represented classes in this dataset.

Below is the figure of the proposed AR-STAR cell

The Attention-based ReLU effectively highlights critical aspects of feature distinction within the data. By amplifying positive features, it accentuates components associated with desired outputs, making them more accessible to the networkâ€™s decision process. Meanwhile, suppressing negative features reduces noise, preventing weak or irrelevant signals from influencing the model. This change enables the STAR cell to create a clear distinction b/w the features and  capture temporal and spatial patterns in most essential way. It is also computationally less intensive than other activation functions.

Experimentally, AR-STAR observed a noticeable boost in its performance, a 4% increase in the F1 score, from 52% to 56%, 6% increase in precision from 60% to 66% over the existing state-of-the-art model on this dataset. These improvements in class-wise metrics are the testimonials of our claims that AR-STAR can handle class imbalance in real-world datasets.
